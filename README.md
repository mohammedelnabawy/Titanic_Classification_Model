# -Titanic_Classification_Model
Hello,<br> <br>
In this project we worked on Titanic dataset to classify the passenger <br>
if passenger is survived or not <br> 
<br> 
On our work used five kind of algorithms to the find algorithm with highest f1_score <br>  
LogisticRegression <br> 
SVC <br> 
DecisionTreeClassifier <br> 
RandomForestClassifier <br> 
VotingClassifier<br>
<br> 
And <br>  
In the end, we found SVC and Decision tree is the best algorithm.
with accurecy score = 100.00 %
and with f1_score = 100.00 %
